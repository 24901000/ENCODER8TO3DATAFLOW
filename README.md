**EXPERIMENT NO : 5 ENCODER 8 TO 3 DATA FLOW**


**AIM:**

To implement  Encoder 8 To 3 in Dataflow Modelling using verilog and validating their functionality using their functional tables

**SOFTWARE REQUIRED:** 

Quartus prime

**THEORY**

The concept of an encoder in data modeling refers to the transformation of a larger set of inputs into a smaller set of outputs that still preserves as much relevant information as possible. In an 8-to-3 encoder, the idea is to map 8 distinct inputs (or states) into a compressed 3-bit binary representation.

1. Purpose

   
An encoder reduces the number of data lines needed to represent multiple inputs.
Itâ€™s commonly used in digital circuits and data compression to efficiently handle large datasets.

2. Basic Operation

   
Each of the 8 inputs corresponds to a unique output represented by a 3-bit binary code.
The encoding process ensures that the information about which input is active is preserved in the compressed 3-bit output.

3. Applications

 
Digital Electronics: Used in priority encoders, multiplexers, and digital signal processors.
Data Compression: Reduces the number of bits for efficient storage and transmission.
Communication Systems: Encodes multiple input signals into fewer output channels.


4. Limitations


Loss of Information: Only one input is active at a time; simultaneous active inputs require priority encoding.
Error Susceptibility: In noisy systems, decoding errors might occur.

**Encoder 8 To 3**

The 8 to 3 line Encoder is also known as Octal to Binary Encoder. In 8 to 3 line encoder, there is a total of eight inputs, i.e., D0, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, and D7 and three outputs, i.e., A0, A1, and A2. In 8-input lines, one input-line is set to true at a time to get the respective binary code in the output side. Below are the block diagram and the truth table of the 8 to 3 line encoder.

The logical expression of the term A0, A1, and A2 are as follows:

A0 = D1 + D3 + D5 + D7

A1 = D2 + D3 + D6 + D7

A2 = D4 + D5 + D6 + D7

Logical circuit of the above expressions is given below:
